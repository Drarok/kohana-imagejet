# Image Jet for Kohana

This simple module allows on-the-fly thumbnailing of images, allowing your
HTTPd's caching behaviour to shine through once the initial image has been
created.

## Usage

At present, there's no demo, but I am using this on a production site, so
expect a demo to show in in a few days.
